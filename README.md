# Prediction of Heparin Resistance--Pediatric Data

## Heparin Resistance

Heparin Resistance is defined by the inability to reach therapeutic level with rising doses of Heparin.

#### Important Indicators

- Heparin(Units/kg/hr)
- Antithrombin
- Lab values for monitoring the effectiveness of Heparin:
  - PTT (sec)
  - Anti-Xa (I.U./mL)



## Objective

Predict whether a child will be Heparin Resistance after a period of measurement of physiologic observations, laboratory results, administered drugs and interventions.
- Prediction at the time before Heparin dosage
- Prediction at the time after certain hours of Heparin administered



## Data Set
Patients in both PICU and Cticu who had Heparin administered at any time and had either PTT or Anti-Xas measurement
-Total Patients: 14940
-Target Patients: 708  (around 4.74%)
